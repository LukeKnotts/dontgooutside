        You look at Rah. They look scepticle, just like you. You decide to
        politely turn down the soup. The old man frowns. The chef asks,
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="chef">"Are you sure you don't want the soup?"</span> the
        chef sadly says.
      </p>
      <p>
        You catch a negative gesture from Rah out of the corner of your eye.
