        That cookie seems to take the life out of you, or make you susceptible
        to something else doing so. You become an emotionless corpse, living but
        without <span class="livium">life</span>. You live the rest of your life
        with everyone else in town, but nobody in Chegckle has any life. Maybe
        you should not have eaten that cookie.
