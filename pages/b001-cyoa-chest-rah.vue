        Rah, after hearing your answer, sprints off into the woods. Surprised,
        you set off after him. As you run the trees fly past you. You two dodge
        bushes and rocks as you run through the woods. Not long into the forest,
        you reach what looks like a large stone box covered in leaves. It has
        intricate carvings of elaborate designs on it. Rah brushes away the
        plants revealing an odd stone treasure chest, worn from the elements,
        sitting patiently under the brush.
