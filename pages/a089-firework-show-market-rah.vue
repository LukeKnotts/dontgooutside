        Everyone follows the entertainer to the market, including you and Rah.
        At the market, a greater number of purple-dressed people lead the
        citizens of Chegckle into a circle around the large open market plaza.
        The other workers dressed in purple are controlling the flow of people.
        The announcer who is at the plaza's center begins to speak loudly.

        <span class="entertainer">
          "Thank you for coming here! Tonight we have an extra special
          performance for all of you! Hopefully, our show will live up to the
          prestige of your amazing little town. If you will, please turn your
          attention to the sky, our show will begin in just a few
          moments,"</span

        announces the 'entertainer.'

      <p>You look at Rah. This guy certainly speaks highly of Chegckle.</p>
      <p>
        Rah's expression turns horrified and they turn to you:
        <span class="rah"
          >"Wait! The people on the radio were talking about fire-"</span
        >
      </p>

        BANG! A squid of blue particles lights up the night sky, like a rip in
        the sky itself. The crowd ooh's and ah's at the fireworks. Then a wave
        of exhaustion hits you. The crowd cheers, but now everything seems
        muted. You look around and notice that the purple suited people are
        leaving the market, weaving their way through the crowd. You look around
        for Rah but don't see them. You spin around pulling at your eyelids to
        keep them open. There. You see Rah wandering around in the crowd.
