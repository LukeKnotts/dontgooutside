        You offer to run around the woods just outside town instead. You don't
        feel like sitting inside today, and you think you two will enjoy
        exploring the forest. It seems like a refreshing change from what you
        two normally do. You tell this to Rah and they don't object. They seem
        to like your idea also.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you head to the opposite side of town, where the east exit that leads
        to the woods is, you make a stop at your house to use the restroom. Rah
        says they'll get a head start into the woods and meet you at the
        enterance of the forest. You serparate from Rah and head into your
        house.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you reach the foot of the woods you don't see Rah. Then you hear
        him coming from off of the main path. You charges up to you breathless,
        gasping for air.

        <span class="Rah">"You won't believe what I've found!"</span> They say
        in exhaustion.<span class="Rah"
          >"Follow me! I've got something to show you!"</span
        >
      </p>
      <p>Whatever this is, Rah seems to be very excited about it.</p>
