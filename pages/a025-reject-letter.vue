        You can't make a decision this big so fast. You decide that you should
        not accept it. And, going to a school like that isn't exactly what you
        want to do right now either.

        Later, that afternoon, you're forced to go to the market to grab some
        food. You don't really feel like going, but you don't have much choice.
        On your way to one of the market stalls, you pass by an open alley.

        In an instant a bag is thrown over your head and you're knocked to the
        ground. Next thing you know, you wake up bumping blindly in a moving
        vehicle. You've been kidnapped.
