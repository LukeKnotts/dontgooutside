        You and Rah make your way over to the docks, though not linearly. You
        have to stop these people, it at the very least to figure out what they
        are doing. The fireworks feel like their covering you two with a
        weighted blanket, trying to make you and Rah asleep. You get to the
        docks, near the boat which is being loaded, but you notice Rah is on the
        ground unconscious a few feet behind you. You rush back and bend down to
        wake them up. You shake Rah. It's no use. You try to stand back up, but
        you don't have the energy. Right there, you go to sleep. You'll
        eventually wake up, but you'll never be the same.
