        You have to figure out what is going on here. So you decide to sneak on
        the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
        you creep across the wood that leads up the ship's side, and walk onto
        the deck of the boat. On the boats deck, you walk past the steering
        wheel and attempt to open the door into the ship's upper-level room. The
        door opens and you step into the ship's room. What you see inside the
        ship is disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the boat, there's some stairs leading below deck, and a desk with
        a large, cluttered bulletin board above it. A large paper map of
        Chegckle is on the bulletin board, with lots of red X's drawn on it. The
        stairs leading downward have strange turcoise stains on them You also
        see a set of, what appears to be fireworks next to the desk. The
        fireworks seem to be hooked up to various cans of gas labeled things
        like 'flammable,' 'corosive,' 'toxic,' '<NuxtLink
          class="secret"
          to="/z002-error"
          >0</NuxtLink
        >,' and 'biohazard.'
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you hear the sound of distant footsteps, followed indistinct
        speaking.
