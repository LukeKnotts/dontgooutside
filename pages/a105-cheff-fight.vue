        You attempt to pull your arm from the man's grasp but their grip is too
        strong. The cheff drags you into the tent behind the stand and throws
        you to the ground. Breifly, you see cooking equipment and pink boxes out
        of the corner of your eyes. You try to get up and face the man, but
        before you're on your feet again you get knocked down and hit in the
        head with something hard.

        You open your eyes. You don't see anything. You try to stretch out your
        legs, but they are stopped by some sort of rough bag like a potato sack
        from extending fully.
