        You look at Rah and you two both make a run for the stairs. You and Rah
        slide down the stairs and into the below room. Rah lets out a terrified
        squeal.

      <p>
        Inside the lower room is the engine, and some sleeping cots. But on the
        walls, making the room feel small, are shelves with bagged bodies. You
        and Rah frankly search for a place you could squeeze into. You two are
        cornered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone in a sharp purple suit walks down the stairs of the boat and
        faces you and Rah. They have long hair that hangs over their face. Just
        below their hair, you can see a smile on the stranger's face.
