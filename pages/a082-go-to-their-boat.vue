        BANG! You fight the erge to sleep and run as well as you can to the
        docks. They're probably trying to take a confusing route to the docks,
        but you won't let them fool you. If they came by boat, they will
        probably leave by boat. Blue from above lights your path as you drag
        yourself to the docks.

      <p>
        You make it to the docks, the movement of your body being the only thing
        keeping you awake. The boat bobs menacingly in the water, and there the
        colorful conpeople are gathering. They are wearing approriately fancy
        masks over their faces, like that of a welder or a hazmat suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        You stagger up to them, and contemplate your next move, or try to
        contemplate your next move, that is. Then you let out a tremendously
        loud yawn, and the purplesuits face you.
