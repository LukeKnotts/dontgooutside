        Rah seems excited to have your attention. They set up their radio. It
        continues to buzz as Rah tries to enhance the audio quality. You are
        mildly surprised it even works. The radio crackles. The small metal
        object buzzes and words begin to flow into the room. But the audio
        buzzes in and out, so some parts are not audible.

        <span class="radio51">
          "The fireworks are still being set up, make sure to alert
          everyone."</span
        >
        The radio buzzes out the unfamiliar voice.

        <span class="radio715">
          "Good. We must now begin the h- ga- - — - ..... - ..."</span

        A woman's voice resopnds, but the end of their sentence is cut off by
        the radio noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="radio51">
          "Alright. -HEY! Careful with those! We don't want anyone - - before it
          even starts! Sorry about that - - - — — .... there will not be any
          mistakes!"</span

        says the first voice.

        <span class="radio715">
          "Good. Make sure tonight goes smoothly. This is 715, signing
          off."</span

        With the final words being said, the radio becomes silent. Rah turns and
        looks at you.
