        The crowd follows the man toward the market, you just one in a large
        group of curious Chegites. You reach the center of the market, the
        plaza, where all of the market's streets converge. There, the crowd is
        gathering around the open space, as guided by several more purple suited
        people. After being directed outside of the circular plaza, the purple
        suits quiet everyone down.

          "Thank you for coming here! Tonight we have an extra special
          performance for your all of you! Hopefully, our show will live up to
          the prestige of your amazing little town."</span

        The entertainer says lavishly.

      <p>Prestige? That's an odd way to talk about Chegckle.</p>

          "If you will, please turn your attention to the sky, our show will

        As they say this, they turn their head upward, and raise the arms
        extranvagantly.

        Events rarely happen in Chegckle. It is nice of him to call Chegckle
        amazing, though you're not sure why anyone would put such effort into a
        performace here. The speaker bows and them and the others dissolve into
        the crowd, as the circle collapses inward and turns to the sky.

        BANG! A beautiful blue firework shatters in the sky, scattering
        amazingly. The crowd ooh's and ah's at the show. A wave of exhaustion
        comes over you, abnormally so. You can see tiny blue particles from the
        explosion raining down, like a soft glittery snow. The crowd cheers, but
        it seems muted.
