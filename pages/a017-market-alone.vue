        You make your trips to the market along, but you're don't hesitate to
        talk to the people at the stands. You enjoy seeing the new things
        vendors offer customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        One day, while at the market, you get hit from behind. In an instant a
        bag is thrown over your head and you're knocked to the ground. Next
        thing you know, you wake up bumping blindly in the back of a moving
        vehicle. You've been kidnapped.
