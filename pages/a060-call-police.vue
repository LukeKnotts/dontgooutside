        You get to your house without anything else happening. You don't feel
        good though so you decide to call the police. Maybe you're crazy, or
        paranoid, but you don't want to take any chances.
      </p>
      <p>
        You call the police and tell them everything you saw. You hope they
        believe you and take you seriously. The officer on the phone listens
        quietly, and once you finish, begins to speak to you.

          "We've been hearing about some suspicious behavior around the docks
          that seems to match what you're saying. We're looking into it, but it
          doesn't seem like anything to worry about. If you're concerned, you
          can always just stay indoors. But we assure you, nothing bad is going
          on, and if there was, we would be on top of it."</span

        The phone cop calmly instructs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're relieved by their response. It doesn't seem like anything too bad
        is going on. You're still on edge, but you told the authorities, and
        you're not out getting involved in who knows what.
      </p>
      <p>
        The day is coming to an end, and you are able to calm yourself down, so
        you get ready to go to bed. But, that night as you're winding down, you
        see a blue flickering light from outside your window. You step toward
        your window and look out to see what's going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        You see the blue lights coming from the docks, and a crowd gathering
        there. What on earth could be going on?
