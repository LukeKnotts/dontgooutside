        You tell Rah that if you two want to figure out what is going on, you
        two should further investigate the stand. So, you and Rah conclude
        you'll order some food from the stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rah and you walk up to the stand to order food from these odd people.
        You ask what they are selling, to which the purple dressed man laughs
        softly.

          "Oh no, you two don't need any money. Since you haven't come before,
          let me bring you the chef's special."</span

        Chirps the chef.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chef winks to Rah, and steps behind the curtain before either of you
        respond. Only a few minutes later, the man reappears smiling, with two
        warm metal bowls in his hands. He sets the bowls down in front of you
        and Rah, and eagerly waits for you two to try them.
