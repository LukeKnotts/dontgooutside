        You and Rah make a run for it. You hope to get off the boat, and you'll
        jump overboard if you have to. You throw open the door and run as fast
        as you can. As you run, you hardly see the purple-suited worker in front
        of you. You see the edge of the boat and you jump. Your feet leave the
        ground and you begin to travel off the boat. Then the back of your shirt
        is yanked, and like a slingshot, you land back on the ground. You land
        with a thud, which is followed by a the powerful fist of the stranger
        who is standing over you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next thing you know, you're bumping blindly in the back of something
        moving. You have no sense of direction, and something rough on your skin
        is restricting you from fully spreading out.
