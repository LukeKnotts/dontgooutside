        You look at Rah. Maybe this is linked to the radio calls you have been
        picking up. You and Rah run out the door and join the crowd gathered
        around the docks. You two reach the funky looking boat emitting all the
        light. There a man dressed in a fancy purple suit is welcoming people
        around the glowing floatation device. He greets them and then begins to
        speak.

        They smile and begins to lead the crowd up the street north toward the
        market. Some other similarly dressed workers are loading boxes onto the
        boat behind the announcer.
