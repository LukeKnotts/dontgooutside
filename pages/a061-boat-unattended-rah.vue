        The water slaps against the peculiar boat still sitting in the river.
        There, the fancy worker is talking into their communication device. You
        and Rah keep your eyes on the strange boat and its rider.

          "Be prepared to head back tonight. We can't have any delays,"</span
        >
        she says into the buzzing device.

        Then, they seem to do something on their electronic communicater, and
        pocket it. They walk down the wood planks leading onto the boats deck,
        and walk off in the direction of the market. After they're out of view,
        the boat seems completely unattended.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="rah">"I wonder what's on that boat,"</span> Rah says,
        though quieter than necessary since you two are now alone.
