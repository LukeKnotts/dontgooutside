        You shift your weight in an attempt to get your bearings, but you are
        too slow. Next thing you know, your swept off your feet by a swift kick,
        and your headed for the ground head over heels.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't see anything. Suddenly you slide and hit your head on
        something metal. You feel like your in a moving vehicle. You try to move
        but your tightly wrapped in some sort of rough sack. Where's Rah? What
        happened?
