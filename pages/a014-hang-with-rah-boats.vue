        You and Rah enjoy hanging out by the river docks together watching the
        boats. You two enjoy seeing what ships come in and the different things
        and people they bring.

        One day, an odd and fancy looking steamer docks at the river. It has
        strange colorful lights and has an odd sleek design to it. It looks
        expensive.

      <p>
        <span class="rah">"I wonder what that boat's for..."</span> Rah says to
        you, perplexed.
