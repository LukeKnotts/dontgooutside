      <p>
        <em>Don't Go Outside</em> is an interactive novel inspired by the
        <em>Choose Your Own Adventure</em> books. Below are the creators of
        <em>Don't Go Outside</em>. This project took us all a while, and is
        still kinda a work in progress. Thank you for taking a look at the
        things we're up to.
