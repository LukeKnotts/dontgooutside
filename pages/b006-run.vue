        You run. This isn't good, you need to leave. Now. Are these fireworks
        normal? You don't spend much time thinking. Instead all of your energy
        goes to running, and keeping yourself awake. You quickly reach
        Chegckle's cozy cobblestone wall entrance, and fly by it. You have to
        keep moving. BANG! BANG! More fireworks explode over the once quiet town
        of Chegckle. You leave the town and run away from it as far you can.
        Luckily, it gets easier and easier to keep yourself awake the further
        from Chegckle you get.

        You decide to follow the railroad tracks south because you don't know
        where else to go. You keep your focus on moving. The only things keeping
        you awake are the burning of your legs, and fixing all of your focus on
        the railroad tracks in front of you. After a while, or what feels like a
        while, you look back behind you. Chegckle is small flickering blue light
        in the distance. You let out a life draining cough, and fall asleep
        right there on the ground.
