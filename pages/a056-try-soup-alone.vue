        The bowl of magnificantly smelling savory soup sits in front of you. The
        purple-suited chef continues watches you. You take the spoon sitting in
        the bowl, and wait to taste the great smelling food. But the taste never
        fills your mouth.

        The next thing you know, you're bumping blindly around in some rough bag
        of sorts.
