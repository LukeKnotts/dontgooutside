        This is perfect! You might be able to finally figure out what these
        purple suit boat people are up to. You accept the old man's offer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The man welcomes you behind the counter and tells you to step through
        the curtain. You step through the curtain. Inside the set-up room is
        some cooking equipment, and various pink boxes with strange labels.
        Before you can do anything else, you feel something hard and metal on
        your head, and you get knocked out.
      </p>
      <p>
        You try to move. You feel something rough all around you, and you can't
        see. What is going on? What has happened to you?
