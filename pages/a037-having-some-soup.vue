        Finally, the man comes out from behind the curtains holding two bowls of
        magnificently smelling soup. He sets them down on the stand's counter in

        your soup now. Two wooden spoons are already sitting in the metal bowls.

      <p>
        You pick up the spoon and take a bite of the soup, waiting to feel its
        warmth go down your body. You eagerly wait to feel the food on your
        tongue, but you never do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next thing you know, you feel a rough potatoe sack all around you.
        You can't see anything. You've been kidnapped.
