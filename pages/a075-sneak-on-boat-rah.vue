        You and Rah are going to sneak on this boat while the people are away.
        Something is going on hear, and you and Rah are going to get to the
        bottom of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rah and you walk on the wood leading up to the boat, and cautiously step
        over the side of the boat. You two walk across the boat's deck to the
        door leading into the boats mysterious interior. Rah reaches out his
        hand, attempting to open the door. It opens. You and Rah tip-toe into
        the boat's upper room, and what you two see is disturbing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside the boat, there's some stairs leading below deck, and a desk with
        a large, cluttered bulletin board above it. A large paper map of
        Chegckle is on the bulletin board, with lots of red X's drawn on it. The
        stairs leading downward have strange turcoise stains on them You also
        see a set of, what appears to be fireworks next to the desk. The
        fireworks seem to be hooked up to various cans of gas labeled things
        like 'flammable,' 'corosive,' 'toxic,' '<NuxtLink
          class="secret"
          to="/z002-error"
          >0</NuxtLink
        >,' and 'biohazard.'
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="rah">
          "Wait... remember how those workers were talking about a distraction,
          and fireworks? Look, these fireworks are attached to these cans of
          gas..."</span
        >
        Rah says, thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you and Rah hear the sound of footsteps. The sound of muffled
        talking comes into earshot along with the growing louder footsteps.
