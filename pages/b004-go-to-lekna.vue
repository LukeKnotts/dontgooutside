        This is your chance to leave Chegckle and see the world. This is your
        chance to maybe do something important.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you decide to use the ticket to take the train, -that leaves tonight.
        You pack for the semester a bit faster than you would like to make it to
        the small train station in Chegckle. The Chegckle train station is super
        small and only has a single track. Trains don't often come through, and
        when they do, it's usually just to pass by. The train station leads to
        the country's captial, and down the coast in the direction of Lekna.

        Sure enough, after a little waiting at the train station, the train
        rolls into the small station just as predicted. You think you've only
        seen the train a handful of times. You get on to the train and it begins
        to head off to Lekna. As you get in you're surprised by the beautiful
        decoration and design of the train. You've never been on it, and it
        feels very fancy. In 20 hours, you'll arrive in the coastal city of
        Lekna.
