        You creep slowly toward the workers and wave for Rah to follow. What
        could this boat be doing? And where could it be going? You and Rah
        listen to what they're saying.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="boat-worker1">"This is going to be big,"</span> The first
        worker says.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="boat-worker2">
          "Whatever, let's just get along with it. The same thing happens to
          every town. You know the entertainment is just a distraction,"</span
        >
        says the second worker back to the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="boat-worker1">
          "Do you think they're going to do those fireworks again? Those were
          incredible. You'd better not just stay below deck tonight. Soon
          enough, when we move on with our lives, you'd'a wished you enjoyed
          these things while we had 'em."</span
        >
        As the first worker says this, seemingly ignoring the second worker's
        response, you and Rah can see a wonder spread across their face.
      </p>
      <p>Rah gives you a look.</p>
      <p>
        <span class="rah">"What could this possibly mean?"</span> they whisper.
      </p>
      <p>
        You wonder the exact same thing. What are they doing here and why here?
        What do they mean by distraction?
