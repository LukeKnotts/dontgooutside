        You tell Rah that you two should get on that boat. Then you can figure
        out what these people are up to. You push through the last of the crowd
        and run up to the boat bobbing in the docks. You and Rah watch carefully
        as the last colorfully dressed worker sets the crate they're carrying on
        the deck, and then follows the rest of the people and workers off to the
        market.
      </p>
      <p><span class="rah">"Now's our chance,"</span> whispers Rah.</p>
      <p>
        You two move up the wood connecting the boat to the docks and onto the
        boat's deck. You're on the deck of the boat. Hopefully nobody saw you.
        But maybe they heard you. Footsteps from below the deck begin getting
        louder and louder.
