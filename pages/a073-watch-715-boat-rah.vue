        The workers go off to the market, and the more formal looking worker
        unlaods the last crate from the boat. The worker heads below deck, and
        you and Rah wait.

      <p>
        <span class="rah">"I wonder what they're doing..."</span> Rah ponders.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a little while, they resurface. With a strange communication
        device in hand, the worker seems to be on a call with somebody.
