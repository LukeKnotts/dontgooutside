        The magnificantly smelling bowls of soup sit in front of you and Rah,
        and they look delicious. You decide to try it. Rah and you pick up the
        spoons and try the soup. Maybe you'll get a better idea of what these
        people are doing. You highly anticipate the soup's arrival into your
        mouth, but it never comes.

        You open your eyes and throw your arms around in distress. Your cold and
        you can't see. You feel a bag all around you. You seem to be on a hard
        metal surface. You've been kidnapped.
