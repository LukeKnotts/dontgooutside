Something is going on hear, and you and Rah are going to get to the bottom of it. </p><p> Rah and you walk on the wood leading up to the boat, and cautiously step over the side of the boat. You two walk across the boat&#39;s deck to the door leading into the boats mysterious interior. Rah reaches out his hand, attempting to open the door. It opens. You and Rah tip-toe into the boat&#39;s upper room, and what you two see is disturbing. </p><p> Inside the boat, there&#39;s some stairs leading below deck, and a desk with a large, cluttered bulletin board above it. A large paper map of Chegckle is on the bulletin board, with lots of red X&#39;s drawn on it. The stairs leading downward have strange turcoise stains on them You also see a set of, what appears to be fireworks next to the desk. The fireworks seem to be hooked up to various cans of gas labeled things like &#39;flammable,&#39; &#39;corosive,&#39; &#39;toxic,&#39; and &#39;biohazard.&#39; </p><p><span class="rah"> &quot;Wait... remember how those workers were talking about a distraction, and fireworks? Look, these fireworks are attached to these cans of gas...&quot;</span> Rah says, thinking. </p><p> Then you and Rah hear the sound of footsteps. The sound of muffled talking comes into earshot along with the growing louder footsteps. </p><p class="choices"><a href="/a094-is-reading-urls-cheating" class="">Go below deck</a><a href="/a085-get-off-boat-rah" class="">Get off the boat</a></p></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/a075-sneak-on-boat-rah/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1679865841177})}</script><script type="module" src="/_nuxt/entry.a82b6d56.js" crossorigin></script></body>
