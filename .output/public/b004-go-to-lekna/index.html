This is your chance to maybe do something important. </p><p> So you decide to use the ticket to take the train, -that leaves tonight. You pack for the semester a bit faster than you would like to make it to the small train station in Chegckle. The Chegckle train station is super small and only has a single track. Trains don&#39;t often come through, and when they do, it&#39;s usually just to pass by. The train station leads to the country&#39;s captial, and down the coast in the direction of Lekna. </p><p> Sure enough, after a little waiting at the train station, the train rolls into the small station just as predicted. You think you&#39;ve only seen the train a handful of times. You get on to the train and it begins to head off to Lekna. As you get in you&#39;re surprised by the beautiful decoration and design of the train. You&#39;ve never been on it, and it feels very fancy. In 20 hours, you&#39;ll arrive in the coastal city of Lekna. </p><p class="choices"><a href="/phase-2-soon-maybe" class="">Continue</a></p></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/b004-go-to-lekna/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1679865841423})}</script><script type="module" src="/_nuxt/entry.a82b6d56.js" crossorigin></script></body>
