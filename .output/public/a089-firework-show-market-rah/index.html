At the market, a greater number of purple-dressed people lead the citizens of Chegckle into a circle around the large open market plaza. The other workers dressed in purple are controlling the flow of people. The announcer who is at the plaza&#39;s center begins to speak loudly. </p><p><span class="entertainer"> &quot;Thank you for coming here! Tonight we have an extra special performance for all of you! Hopefully, our show will live up to the prestige of your amazing little town. If you will, please turn your attention to the sky, our show will begin in just a few moments,&quot;</span> announces the &#39;entertainer.&#39; </p><p>You look at Rah. This guy certainly speaks highly of Chegckle.</p><p> Rah&#39;s expression turns horrified and they turn to you: <span class="rah">&quot;Wait! The people on the radio were talking about fire-&quot;</span></p><p> BANG! A squid of blue particles lights up the night sky, like a rip in the sky itself. The crowd ooh&#39;s and ah&#39;s at the fireworks. Then a wave of exhaustion hits you. The crowd cheers, but now everything seems muted. You look around and notice that the purple suited people are leaving the market, weaving their way through the crowd. You look around for Rah but don&#39;t see them. You spin around pulling at your eyelids to keep them open. There. You see Rah wandering around in the crowd. </p><p class="choices"><a href="/a098-follow-rah" class="">Follow Rah</a><a href="/a099-leave-rah-market-night" class="">Keep watch on the purplesuit&#39;s &#39;show&#39;</a><a href="/b006-run" class="">Leave Rah, you have to run!</a></p></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/a089-firework-show-market-rah/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1679865841269})}</script><script type="module" src="/_nuxt/entry.a82b6d56.js" crossorigin></script></body>
