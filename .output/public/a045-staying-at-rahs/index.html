You and Rah have to know what&#39;s going on. For a while, there is nothing. Rah endlessly tinkers with the radio, but you don&#39;t get much more than static. Occasionally, something that sounds like it could be more than noise will come out of the radio, but then it stops before Rah can pick out anything. At one point, you catch some random radio show, but that&#39;s not what you&#39;re looking for. Then, finally, the radio begins to buzz with something audible. Late evening is upon you, and orange light floods through the open window. </p><p><span class="radio51">&quot;The fireworks are almost ready.&quot;</span> A man&#39;s voice buzzes clearly from the radio. </p><p>You look at Rah. It&#39;s the same dude as from earlier.</p><p><span class="radio715">&quot;Be ready to leave before the last firework is lit,&quot;</span> A voice responds. And its the same woman&#39;s voice as from before! </p><p><span class="rah">&quot;It&#39;s 715...&quot;</span> Rah mumbles.</p><p><span class="radio715">&quot;Remember, once we secure the <span class="livium">livium</span> we leave,&quot;</span> &#39;715&#39; continues. </p><p><span class="radio51">&quot;Yes 715. Do you have your masks?&quot;</span> the person at the other end of the radio responds. </p><p><span class="radio715"> &quot;The filters are almost finished being cleaned from Lekna,&quot;</span> the woman responds. </p><p class="radio51">&quot;Alright. This is 51, signing off.&quot;</p><p> The radio continues to make static sounds, and then stops. You can see Rah mouthing the word &#39;51.&#39; </p><p><span class="rah">&quot;This is serious.&quot;</span>Rah says.</p><p>Who is 51? What is <span class="livium">livium</span>?</p><p><span class="rah">&quot;Do you think you should go home?&quot;</span> Rah says, worried. </p><p class="choices"><a href="/a036-go-home-boats-alone" class="">Head home and be cautious</a><a href="/a057-radio-night" class="">Keep listening</a></p></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/a045-staying-at-rahs/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1679865840983})}</script><script type="module" src="/_nuxt/entry.a82b6d56.js" crossorigin></script></body>
