You reach the center of the market, the plaza, where all of the market&#39;s streets converge. There, the crowd is gathering around the open space, as guided by several more purple suited people. After being directed outside of the circular plaza, the purple suits quiet everyone down. </p><p><span class="entertainer"> &quot;Thank you for coming here! Tonight we have an extra special performance for your all of you! Hopefully, our show will live up to the prestige of your amazing little town.&quot;</span> The entertainer says lavishly. </p><p>Prestige? That&#39;s an odd way to talk about Chegckle.</p><p><span class="entertainer"> &quot;If you will, please turn your attention to the sky, our show will begin in just a few moments.&quot;</span> As they say this, they turn their head upward, and raise the arms extranvagantly. </p><p> Events rarely happen in Chegckle. It is nice of him to call Chegckle amazing, though you&#39;re not sure why anyone would put such effort into a performace here. The speaker bows and them and the others dissolve into the crowd, as the circle collapses inward and turns to the sky. </p><p> BANG! A beautiful blue firework shatters in the sky, scattering amazingly. The crowd ooh&#39;s and ah&#39;s at the show. A wave of exhaustion comes over you, abnormally so. You can see tiny blue particles from the explosion raining down, like a soft glittery snow. The crowd cheers, but it seems muted. </p><p class="choices"><a href="/a071-watching-fireworks" class="">Watch the show</a><a href="/b006-run" class="">Get as far away from here as you can</a><a href="/a072-follow-purplesuits-market" class="">Try to follow one of the purplesuits</a></p></div></div><!--]--><!--]--><!--]--></div><script type="module">import p from "/a049-firework-show-market/_payload.js";window.__NUXT__={...p,...({state:{},_errors:{},serverRendered:true,config:{public:{},app:{baseURL:"\u002F",buildAssetsDir:"\u002F_nuxt\u002F",cdnURL:""}},prerenderedAt:1679865841009})}</script><script type="module" src="/_nuxt/entry.a82b6d56.js" crossorigin></script></body>
