      You get to your house without anything else happening. You don't feel
      good though so you decide to call the police. Maybe you're crazy, or
      paranoid, but you don't want to take any chances.
    </p> <p>
      You call the police and tell them everything you saw. You hope they
      believe you and take you seriously. The officer on the phone listens
      quietly, and once you finish, begins to speak to you.
    </p> <p><span class="phone-fake-cop">
        "We've been hearing about some suspicious behavior around the docks
        that seems to match what you're saying. We're looking into it, but it
        doesn't seem like anything to worry about. If you're concerned, you
        can always just stay indoors. But we assure you, nothing bad is going
        on, and if there was, we would be on top of it."</span>
      The phone cop calmly instructs.
    </p> <p>
      You're relieved by their response. It doesn't seem like anything too bad
      is going on. You're still on edge, but you told the authorities, and
      you're not out getting involved in who knows what.
    </p> <p>
      The day is coming to an end, and you are able to calm yourself down, so
      you get ready to go to bed. But, that night as you're winding down, you
      see a blue flickering light from outside your window. You step toward
      your window and look out to see what's going on.
    </p> <p>
      You see the blue lights coming from the docks, and a crowd gathering
      there. What on earth could be going on?
